# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Image Classification using CNN

Topics
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Deep Neural Networks
* Computer Vision
* ML Classification

Packages Used
* keras
* numpy
* matplotlib

The purpose of this code is to show how one can build a CNN to classify images. This code classifies the images from the CIFAR-10 dataset with an acccuracy of 85%. We can use this as a base and build on top of it to improve the model performance.

CIFAR is an acronym that stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research and the CIFAR-10 dataset was developed by researchers at the CIFAR institute. The dataset is comprised of 60,000 32Ã—32 pixel color photographs of objects from 10 classes, such as frogs, birds, cats, ships, etc. These are very small images, much smaller than a typical photograph, and the dataset is intended for computer vision research.
